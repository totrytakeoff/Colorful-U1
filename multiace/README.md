# mUlt1ACE

## What's new in 0.81b

USB-level misbehaviour related to the ACE Pro's internal reset cycle could cause sporadic failures mid-print when switching between ACEs on every toolchange. This release works around it by keeping a single connection to the ACE that was active when the print started - the *start ACE* - and never disconnecting from it for the duration of the print.

**Trade-off:** during a print, only the start ACE has feed_assist available. Heads on other ACEs print without feed_assist; the extruder pulls the filament directly through the bowden. Validated through several hours of multi-color test prints without visible underextrusion. For unusually long bowden routing or high-friction filament, pick the start ACE deliberately with `ACE_SWITCH TARGET=N` so your most-used material lives on it. The next major version (v0.82) will lift this restriction.

**Bonus:** cross-ACE toolchanges no longer pay the ~5–10 second USB disconnect/reconnect cost.

**Logging:** dedicated state, USB, and FA debug logs are available for post-mortem analysis (`state_debug` / `usb_debug` / `fa_debug` in `[ace]`). All default OFF - please enable before reporting bugs so logs capture the issue.

## multiACE v0.81b "First Light" Hotfix 1

**Multi-ACE Pro support for Snapmaker U1 with Klipper**

> ⚠️ **Beta Software** - This is a community-driven development project for enabling multiple Anycubic ACE Pro filament changers on Snapmaker printers. While carefully tested, it relies on community feedback and testing to mature. Use at your own risk. Please report issues and share your experience to help improve multiACE for everyone.

> **Important Note:** Both the Snapmaker U1 and the Anycubic ACE Pro have their own quirks with filament loading/unloading, RFID detection (possibly related to tag sticker positioning), and occasional mechanical issues. Not every problem encountered is a multiACE issue - many are inherent to the underlying hardware. This is a beta release, not a production-ready solution. Whether these U1 and ACE Pro limitations can be resolved in the future remains to be seen.

## What is multiACE?

multiACE extends the [SnapACE](https://github.com/BlackFrogKok/SnapACE) software to support **multiple ACE Pro units** on a single Snapmaker U1 printer. Switch between ACE units to use different filament sets - for example, PLA on ACE 0 and PETG on ACE 1 - without physically swapping spools.

## Typical Workflow

### Single Toolhead + Single ACE MVP

This workflow is for the current hardware-test path where all four ACE
slots feed one physical U1 toolhead through a 4-to-1 splitter. It lets a
normal four-colour slicer profile drive one physical toolhead by rewriting
virtual slicer tools to explicit ACE slot swaps.

1. In the multiACE dashboard, set exactly one toolhead to **ACE** and set
   the ACE target to that same toolhead. Leave the other toolheads
   **Native**.
2. Configure the four ACE slots with the material and colour that match
   the slicer's virtual tools.
3. Upload the G-code through the multiACE upload/preflight button, not
   directly through the stock Moonraker upload page.
4. In preflight, use **Printer layout (as loaded)**. The MVP disables
   Optimize and Layer layouts for real printing.
5. Verify that each row shows `ACE <n> Slot <m> -> T<physical head>` and
   that all rows point to the ACE toolhead.
6. Start the print from the preflight dialog.

The post-processed G-code emits explicit commands such as:

```gcode
ACE_SWAP_HEAD HEAD=3 ACE=0 SLOT=0
ACE_SWAP_HEAD HEAD=3 ACE=0 SLOT=1
```

`HEAD` is the physical U1 toolhead index, while `SLOT` is the ACE spool
slot. Changing the printer-side retract settings does not require
re-slicing; the same already-postprocessed test G-code can be used after a
Klipper restart.

#### Field note: 2026-06-04 single-head MVP print

The single-head path was validated on a U1 where ACE0 slots 0-3 feed
physical head 3 through a 4-to-1 splitter. A real four-colour file
(`puzle_PETG_11m6s.gcode`) was started after configuring head 3 as the ACE
head. The initial auto-load mapped slicer tool 2 to `ACE0 / Slot2` and
successfully loaded head 3 from that slot.

One failure found during this run was a false
`swap slot_empty (post-unload)` pause. The ACE per-device status reported
all four slots ready, but the legacy top-level `gate_status` field still
contained unknown values. The fix keeps the active ACE top-level gate state
in sync with the per-ACE state and forces a fresh ACE status read before
slot availability checks in `ACE_LOAD_HEAD` and `ACE_SWAP_HEAD`.

Expected healthy state after Klipper restart:

```text
ace.gate_status          = [1, 1, 1, 1]
ace.aces[0].gate_status  = [1, 1, 1, 1]
head_source[3]           = {"ace_index": 0, "slot": <active slot>, ...}
```

#### Field note: 2026-06-05 stale Web alerts

During the next single-head print, the Web UI still showed an old
`multiACE alerts` entry for `swap slot_empty (post-unload)`, but Moonraker
reported `print_stats.state=printing`, `pause_resume.is_paused=false`,
`print_stats.exception={}`, and the Klippy log showed successful swaps
after the restart. This was a stale multiACE Web notification, not a new
Klipper-side failure.

The Web backend now prunes notifications older than the current healthy
print session, and the frontend applies the same cutoff to its local alert
list. If a similar alert appears while the print keeps running, first check
`print_stats.exception`, `pause_resume.is_paused`, and the latest Klippy log
before treating it as a new swap failure.

### Single Material (e.g. PLA on ACE 0)

1. Insert spools into ACE 0
2. Press **ACEB__Load_0** → loads all filled slots
3. Print normally

### Multiple Materials (e.g. PLA on ACE 0, PETG on ACE 1)

1. Insert PLA spools into ACE 0, PETG spools into ACE 1
2. Load PLA toolheads (T0-T2) via display
3. Press **ACEA__Switch_1** → switch to ACE 1
4. Load PETG into desired toolhead (e.g. T3) via display or **ACEC__Load_T3**
5. Toolchanges during print automatically switch between ACEs

### Switching Complete Filament Sets

1. Press **ACEC__Unload_All** → unloads everything
2. Press **ACEB__Load_1** → switch to ACE 1 and load all

### Switching ACE Units

Use the Fluidd macros **ACEA__Switch_0..3** to switch between ACE units.

> **Note on macro names:** The macro names use letter prefixes (ACEA, ACEB, ACEC...) to ensure they appear in a logical order in Fluidd's alphabetical macro list. If you prefer different names, you can rename them anytime in `config/extended/ace.cfg`.

## Hardware Setup

### Cable Building Guide (Solder-Free)

The ACE Pro connects to the Snapmaker U1 via USB using a Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connector. No soldering required.

**What You Need:**
- 1x Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 Male 2x3 connector with pre-crimped wires - [AliExpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005010370245711.html)
- 1x USB Type-A screw terminal adapter - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0825TWRW7)

**Pinout:**

```
ACE Pro Molex (2x3) - front view          Connection
         ||  <- clip
   ┌────────────┐
   │ [1] [2] [3] │                        Pin 2 (D-)  -> USB D-
   │ [4] [5] [6] │                        Pin 3 (D+)  -> USB D+
   └────────────┘                         Pin 5 (GND) -> USB GND
                                          Pin 6 (VCC) -> NOT CONNECTED
```

Refer to the [SnapAce pinout diagram](https://github.com/BlackFrogKok/SnapAce/blob/main/.github/img/pinout.png) for the exact Molex pin positions.

> **Important:** Pin 6 (VCC) is not connected - the ACE Pro has its own power supply. Can be dangerous for your printer. Molex cables have no standardized color coding. Always measure continuity before connecting.

**Assembly:**
1. Connect D-, D+, and GND from the Molex connector to D-, D+, and GND on the USB connector
2. Twist D+ and D- wires together (2-3 twists per cm) to reduce electromagnetic interference
3. If using a cut USB cable: wrap the exposed section with aluminum foil overlapping the cable shield
4. Additional ACE units connect via the daisy chain cable (included with ACE Pro) - no additional USB cables needed for units 2+

### ACE Connection Overview

Each ACE Pro connects to the printer via **two interfaces**:
- **USB** - Serial communication (commands, status, RFID)
- **PTFE tubes** - Filament path from ACE slots to toolheads

All ACE units are wired **in parallel** - each ACE slot feeds the **same toolhead** as the corresponding slot on every other ACE. This allows switching entire filament sets by switching the active ACE.

```
                    Splitter
ACE 0  Slot 0 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 0 ──────┤──── Head 0 (T0)
ACE 2  Slot 0 ──────┘

ACE 0  Slot 1 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 1 ──────┤──── Head 1 (T1)
ACE 2  Slot 1 ──────┘

ACE 0  Slot 2 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 2 ──────┤──── Head 2 (T2)
ACE 2  Slot 2 ──────┘

ACE 0  Slot 3 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 3 ──────┤──── Head 3 (T3)
ACE 2  Slot 3 ──────┘
```

### USB Connection

Each ACE Pro connects to the Snapmaker U1 via USB (data only - each ACE has its own power supply). The ACE units are daisy-chained through the USB ports on the back of each ACE:

```
Snapmaker U1 USB Port
        │
      ACE 0 ─── ACE 1 ─── ACE 2 ─── ACE 3
       (USB out → USB in, daisy chain)
```

> **Note:** VCC (5V) is not connected in the USB cable - only data lines. Each ACE Pro is powered by its own external power supply.

multiACE detects ACE units automatically by USB vendor/product ID (28e9:018a). The order of the daisy chain determines the ACE index (0, 1, 2, 3).

### PTFE Tube Splitters

Each toolhead needs a **splitter** that merges PTFE tubes from multiple ACE units into a single path to the extruder. With splitters installed, you can switch between ACE units **and** back to Normal Mode (stock feeders) without recabling.

- **3D print** a Y-splitter or multi-way splitter
- **Use commercial** PTFE tube connectors with multiple inputs

> **Tip:** Keep all PTFE tube lengths as equal as possible between ACE units. Adjust `load_length` per toolhead in `ace.cfg` if needed.

### RFID Spool Tags

The ACE Pro reads RFID tags from Anycubic spools to automatically detect filament type, color, and brand. For third-party spools without RFID, you can write compatible tags yourself:

- **Tags** - Use NFC NTAG 213 or 215 stickers
- **iPhone** - TagMySpool app
- **Android** - RFID ACE app

Spools without RFID tags work fine - you can set the filament type and color manually via the Snapmaker display.

### Recommended Setup

| ACE Units | Use Case | Setup |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| 2 ACEs | Material switching (e.g. PLA + PETG) | 2-way splitters, direct USB |
| 2 ACEs | Extended color range (8 colors) | 2-way splitters, direct USB |
| 3-4 ACEs | Multi-material + colors | N-way splitters, USB hub |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing multiACE, ensure the following:

1. **Firmware** - Install Snapmaker firmware 1.2+ or PAXX firmware 12-14 on your Snapmaker U1
2. **Enable Root Access** - On the Snapmaker display, go to Settings > About > tap firmware version 10 times to unlock Advanced Mode, then enable Root Access
3. **Enable SSH** - Connect via SSH or serial console and run:
   ```
   touch /home/lava/.oem_debug
   ```
   After reboot, Wi-Fi password needs to be re-entered on the display. SSH is then available at `root@<printer-ip>`
4. **Verify SSH** - Connect from your computer:
   ```
   ssh root@<printer-ip>
   ```

### Quick Install (Recommended)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `multiace/` folder to your printer via SCP/SFTP (e.g. WinSCP on Windows, or command line):
   ```
   scp -r multiace/ root@<printer-ip>:/tmp/multiace/
   ```
3. SSH into the printer and run:
   ```
   bash /tmp/multiace/install_multiace.sh
   ```
4. Reboot the printer
5. multiACE starts in **Multi mode** - all connected ACE units are detected automatically

### Manual Install

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Copy Klipper extras to the printer:
   ```
   cp klipper/extras/ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/
   cp klipper/extras/filament_feed_ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/
   cp klipper/extras/filament_switch_sensor_ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/
   cp klipper/kinematics/extruder_ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/kinematics/
   ```

2. Copy config files:
   ```
   cp config/extended/ace.cfg /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/
   mkdir -p /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace
   cp config/extended/multiace/ace_vars.cfg /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/
   cp config/extended/multiace/ace_mode_switch.sh /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/
   chmod +x /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/ace_mode_switch.sh
   ```

3. Activate ACE file swap:
   ```
   bash /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/ace_mode_switch.sh ace
   ```

4. Delete Python cache:
   ```
   rm -rf /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/__pycache__/
   rm -rf /home/lava/klipper/klippy/kinematics/__pycache__/
   ```

5. Reboot the printer

### Uninstall

Run the uninstall script (installed automatically to the printer):
```
bash /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/uninstall_multiace.sh
```

Or from the install folder:
```
bash /tmp/multiace/uninstall_multiace.sh
```

Then reboot. The printer returns to stock operation.

## Configuration

All settings are in `config/extended/ace.cfg` under the `[ace]` section:

```ini
[ace]

# Number of physically connected ACE Pro devices.
# Default 1 (single ACE - no config change needed). REQUIRED for
# multi-ACE setups (>1): set to your physical count (2..8). At
# startup, multiACE waits up to 20s for all expected devices to
# appear, then locks the path-to-index mapping for the rest of
# the session so a temporarily missing ACE during a USB reset
# cycle never causes index drift.
# ace_device_count: 3

# Logging - default OFF for normal operation. ENABLE before reporting
# a bug: without these traces, nondeterministic issues cannot be
# diagnosed. See the `Debug logging` section below.
# log_dir: /home/lava/printer_data/logs   # default - usually fine
state_debug: false      # per-toolchange / per-load audit log
usb_debug: false        # per-scan / per-connect serial-layer log
fa_debug: false         # feed-assist trace lines in klippy.log

# Serial
baud: 115200

# ACE feed/retract settings
feed_speed: 80          # Feed speed (mm/s)
retract_speed: 30       # Retract speed (mm/s, lower = cleaner winding)
retract_length: 1950    # Distance from extruder to splitter (mm)
load_length: 2100       # ACE feed distance for load (mm)

# feed_length: distance for the filament to reach the toolhead.
# ACE has its own loading procedure and this length does not affect
# it. Pick a value so that after ACE loading the filament is ~5-6 cm
# away from the toolhead. Set to 0 to disable (recommended; the
# preload phase wastes time and gives inconsistent positions).
feed_length: 0

# Retry settings

# retract_length_1: 1900
```

### Configuration Recommendations

**ace_device_count** - Default `1`. **Required for multi-ACE setups**: uncomment and set to your physical ACE count (2..8). The 20s startup wait ensures all devices are detected even if some happen to be mid USB reset cycle when Klipper boots. Without an explicit count, multi-ACE setups risk locking the canonical mapping with one device missing.

**state_debug / usb_debug / fa_debug** - Default `false`. Keep off for normal operation - log files stay small and `klippy.log` stays readable.

> 🐞 **Reporting a bug?** Please enable all three flags **before** reproducing the issue, then attach the freshly generated logs (`klippy.log`, `multiace_state.log`, `multiace_usb.log`) to your report. Nondeterministic multiACE issues (stuck swaps, FA misbehavior, Errno 5 cascades) are near-impossible to diagnose without these traces - a bug report without them often cannot be actioned.

- `state_debug` → writes `multiace_state.log` with per-toolchange / per-load / per-swap audit entries
- `usb_debug` → writes `multiace_usb.log` with per-scan / per-connect serial-layer events
- `fa_debug` → injects `[multiACE-FA]` trace lines into `klippy.log` showing every feed-assist gate and start/stop

**feed_length** - Set to `0` (disabled). The preload phase wastes time when loading ACE slots and leads to inconsistent filament positions in the PTFE tubes.

**load_length** - Set to approximately **110% of your actual PTFE tube length** (from ACE to splitter). The load phase is sensor-controlled and will stop when filament is detected, so a longer value is safe and ensures reliable loading.

**retract_speed** - Keep low (default `30`). The ACE Pro sometimes winds filament loosely at higher speeds, causing tangles on the spool. Additionally, consider printing a spool guide upgrade such as [this ACE Pro roller guide](https://www.printables.com/model/1237589-20-anycubic-ace-pro-upgrade-kit-to-new-s1-version) to improve winding quality.

**retract_length** - Measure the actual distance from your extruder sensor to the PTFE splitter and subtract ~100mm. The retract only needs to pull the filament back past the splitter junction, not the full tube length.

**swap_retract_length** - Print-time colour swaps use this value when
unloading the currently loaded slot before loading the next one. For the
single-toolhead ACE MVP, start conservatively at `1800` so the filament is
pulled clear of the 4-to-1 splitter before the next slot loads. A change to
this value requires a Klipper restart to enter memory, but it does not
require re-slicing the model.

## Known Limitations

- **Unload before first use** - After a fresh install or when upgrading from a previous version, unload all toolheads before using multiACE. Filament loaded from a previous installation may cause unexpected behavior since multiACE has no knowledge of the previous state. Use **ACEC__Unload_All** or unload via display before starting.
- **Single-toolhead ACE MVP only supports current-layout printing** - The Web preflight page may show future Optimize/Layer concepts, but real hardware printing is intentionally limited to the loaded printer layout until multi-head/native+ACE coordination is implemented.
- **Single-toolhead MVP swap status is still under observation** - Real printing can continue correctly after the initial ACE load, but `swap_in_progress` may remain true longer than expected in status output. Treat this as a status/reporting issue to investigate before broadening the MVP to mixed native+ACE heads.
- **Cross-ACE feed_assist** - During a print, only the ACE that was active when the print started has feed_assist available. Toolchanges to heads on other ACEs print without feed_assist (extruder pulls filament directly through the bowden). Pick the start ACE deliberately with `ACE_SWITCH TARGET=N` before the print so your most-used material lives on it. The next major version (v0.82) will lift this restriction.
- **ACE USB Reset** - Inactive ACE units periodically reset their USB connection (~3s cycle). This is normal ACE Pro firmware behavior and does not affect operation. Visible in `dmesg` but harmless.
- **Display Attach Toolhead** - Attaching a toolhead via the Snapmaker display triggers auto-feed. This is stock Snapmaker behavior and cannot be suppressed.
- **Unload All clears display** - After **ACEC__Unload_All**, manually set filament types and colors are cleared. This is by design - reload and set filament info again after unload.
- **load / feed_length per toolhead only** - Will be adressed in next version, set settings to longest path length, sensors check shoukd stop it.

## Troubleshooting

### Reset to clean state

If things get out of sync (wrong filament displayed, unexpected behavior), reset everything:

1. Unload all toolheads via display (make sure no filament is stuck in any head)
2. In Fluidd console: `ACE_CLEAR_HEADS`
3. Power-cycle the printer (full off/on, not just Klipper restart)
4. After reboot, start fresh with loading from ACE 0

### Klipper won't start after install
- Check if `ace.cfg` is included: `grep ace.cfg /home/lava/printer_data/config/printer.cfg`
- Check if `multiace/ace_vars.cfg` exists
- Run uninstall and reinstall

### ACE not detected
- Check USB connection: `ls /dev/serial/by-path/`
- ACE Pro should show as vendor `28e9`, product `018a`
- Try power-cycling the ACE

### Old code running despite update
- Delete Python cache: `rm -rf /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/__pycache__/`
- Check file timestamp in console: `multiACE v0.80b (file: ...)`

### Serial errors on console
- Serial errors during ACE switch are logged silently. If errors persist, check USB cables.

## Roadmap

### Next Version
- Bug fixes based on community feedback
- Custom Fluidd UI panel for ACE management
- Maybe one day: [Full vision](https://youtube.com/video/gJVQikjtDNs)
